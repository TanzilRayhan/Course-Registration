## Question & Answer
### 1. Add at least 3 Project features.
- Feature 01: Responsive Website by using Tailwind CSS
- Feature 02: Functional Add to cart option by using React
- Feature 03: Basic Error Handling by using React Toasts

### 2. Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

In React, state management is a crucial aspect of building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. In this project, I used two state components 'useState' & 'useEffect' hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components.
- useState is a hook that allows functional components to have state. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.

- useEffect is a hook used for handling side effects in functional components. It allows you to perform actions after the component has rendered or in response to changes in state or props.
